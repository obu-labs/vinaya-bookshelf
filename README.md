# The Vinaya Bookshelf Plugin

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) [Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins)
is built for Buddhist Monastics to share their notes about the Vinaya.

This plugin will automatically pull files into your vault about the Vinaya from many sources, such as:
  - The PƒÅli texts and translations on SuttaCentral ([Source](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/vinaya/pli-tv-vi?lang=en) [Code](https://github.com/obu-labs/pali-vinaya-notes))
  - Ajahn Brahmali's Vinaya notes on SuttaCentral ([Source](https://suttacentral.net/edition/pli-tv-vi/en/brahmali/general-introduction?lang=en) [Code](https://github.com/obu-labs/brahmali-vinaya-notes))
  - Bhante Suddhaso's translation of the Bhikkhu Vibhanga ([Source](https://bhantesuddhaso.com/teachings/vinaya/))
  - ...with more coming soon!

The plugin does **not** automatically upload your notes anywhere or collect any data.

## Your Notes

The Bookshelf plugin will ask you to create a folder in your vault which will be your Notebook.

By keeping your notes separate but alongside the books on your Bookshelf,
you can create rich links from your notes to other work.
This makes it easy for you to share your notes with other monastics and know that
your links will work in their Vault too, as long as they have the Bookshelf as well.

## The Bookshelf

Of course, the main benefit of having the Vinaya Bookshelf in your vault is
keeping all the resources you need for studying the Vinaya in one, convenient,
offline, searchable place.

For more information on managing your Bookshelf, see [the docs](https://labs.buddhistuniversity.net/vinaya/docs/guides/modules/).
