# The Vinaya Notebook Plugin

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) [Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins)
is built for Buddhist Monastics to share their notes about the Vinaya.

This plugin will automatically sync notes about the Vinaya from many sources, such as:
  - The PƒÅli texts and translations on SuttaCentral ([Code](https://github.com/obu-labs/pali-vinaya-notes))
  - Ajahn Brahmali's Vinaya notes on SuttaCentral ([Source](https://suttacentral.net/edition/pli-tv-vi/en/brahmali/general-introduction?lang=en) [Code](https://github.com/obu-labs/brahmali-vinaya-notes))
  - Bhante Suddhaso's translation of the Bhikkhu Vibhanga ([Source](https://bhantesuddhaso.com/teachings/vinaya/))
  - ...with more coming soon!

The plugin does **not** automatically upload your notes anywhere or collect any data.

It helps sharing by providing a structure for linking to these references. This
makes it easy for you to share your notes with other monastics and know that
your links and references will work in their Vault too, as long as they have
this plugin installed.

Of course, the main benefit of having the Vinaya Notes vault on your device is
having all the resources you need for studying the Vinaya in one, convenient,
offline, searchable place.

This plugin is still in active development, so feature requests and bug reports
are most welcome as GitHub Issues on this repository.
